                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;">
                    This website was made by two people for the love of anime.
                    We got bored during the lockdown and were watching a lot of anime but at some point we realized that
                    it's really hard to pick a good anime series
                    especially for those who have watched a lot of anime. Moreover, we realized that once you get into
                    this stuff genre really doesn't matter as people who have been
                    watching anime for 2 or more years have watched neraly, every genre possible.</p>
                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;">
                    As such we came up with an idea that genre, probably isn't everything and more parameters like
                    experience and stream should be avalible for people to decide what shows they want't to watch.
                    And keeping this idea in our minds we came up with this website. Extending the service of our
                    website, we have also added a "new to anime" section which will help begineers to watch
                    anime. The anime suggestions are totally based on our discretion and it's fine to differ with the
                    list availabe as we have tried to inculcate different genres and in doing so we might have
                    missed out on many great shows and we totally apologize for that.
                </p>
                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;"> Lastly, we would like to point out that it we have added
                    a stream category which is:-</p>

                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;"> 1. Main Stream- These shows are the common popular types
                    which you might have heard once in a while.</p>

                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;"> 2. Unorthodox- These shows are the ones which are rare
                    and people don't generally hear or talk about them.</p>

                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;">Also, we would like to say that before watching any show,
                    do google them once as some shows might belong to peculiar genres which aren't everyone's cup of
                    tea.
                    Rest aside, we really hope that you'll understand the point of making this website and moerover find
                    some great shows to binge watch. </p>

                <p class="text-light" style="font-weight:600;">
                    Kudos! and keep watching anime....See ya!</p>
